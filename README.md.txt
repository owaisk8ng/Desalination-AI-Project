# AI-Based Desalination Efficiency Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict the efficiency of a seawater desalination plant based on operational parameters.

## Problem Statement
Desalination plants consume high energy. Predicting efficiency helps optimize performance and reduce operational costs.

## Features Used
- Feed Water Salinity (ppm)
- Temperature (°C)
- Pressure (bar)
- Flow Rate (m³/h)
- Energy Consumption (kWh/m³)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Model Used
- Linear Regression

## Results
The model achieves R² score above 0.90 on test data.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the program:
   python desalination_model.py
